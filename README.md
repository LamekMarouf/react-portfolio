# React Portfolio

## Description
This is my personal portfolio that's built on React. I created this to show my skills, projects and experiences.  It outlines and goes through all my skills, projects and socials. I was motivated to build this project because I wanted to have my own portfolio that other Githubbers and employers could see. I have studied at the University of Sydney and Trilogy to achieve a certificate in Full Stack Development. To understand further, plese take a look at my portfolio using the link below.
