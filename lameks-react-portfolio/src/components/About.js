                Hello World! I love and enjoy the process and creativity that
                comes with building websites and apps. I am a graduate of The
                University of Sydney and Trilogyâ€™s Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp.
              </p>
              <p>
                During this course, I have acquired all necessary skills to
                build a full-stack website with languages such as HTML, CSS,
                JavaScript, React and many more listed below. I have had
                experience in building a website from scratch with other fellow
                web developers, so I understand the process and mindset behind
                building something from the bottom up as a team.
              </p>
              <p>
                I have also built a full-stack web application alone so I can
                further understand the process of being independent and relying
                on myself to achieve and accomplish what is needed to be done.
